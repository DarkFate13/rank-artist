I love CoC and plays it more than Samurai seige but what is a really dissapointment in CoC is that you dont get the same benefits of having a clan as you Do in Samurai seige. SS is far more fun When it comes to this point of the game. You have freaking Clan wars in SS!? And you can Do conquests with your clan to get resources. In CoC all you can Do is donate troops and thats make me cry.", "link": "http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:147579", "topic_score": 26.223552227020264, "final_score": 18.689420890808105}, {"lang_score": 63.25, "text_score": 16, "title": "Samurai seige is better than CoC | Clash of Clans Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia", "query": "Is Dota better than Clash of Clans ?\n", "luhn_score": 61, "content": "Forgot your password?Or sign in with one of these servicesStarted by Averykindguy1998, April 30, 2014 \u00b7 9 replies", "link": "https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/146193-clash-of-clans/", "topic_score": 53.96728515625, "final_score": 49.6369140625}, {"lang_score": 91.5, "text_score": 14, "title": "Clash Of Clans - Mobile Gaming - Linus Tech Tips", "query": "Is Dota better than Clash of Clans ?\n", "luhn_score": 23, "content": "Loading...Loading...Loading...Working...Loading...Loading...Working...Loading...Loading...Loading...", "link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQycE_tkwB4", "topic_score": 1.1705196811817586e-07, "final_score": 25.70000004682079}, {"lang_score": 90.0, "text_score": 12, "title": null, "query": "Is Dota better than Clash of Clans ?\n", "luhn_score": 10, "content": "Realore's announced their new Clash of Clans [Free] esque stategy game Warhunger for iPad.

Developer Realore is promising a Dota influence with the heroes in the game, which could be interesting: invoking that game is saying a lot, as Dota is extremely complex and a very balanced game: certainly, a game with balanced heroes like that would be an interesting addition to this crowded genre.
